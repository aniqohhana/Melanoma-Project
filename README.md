# Melanoma Detection Application
Melanoma Detection Application is a website built with Streamlit that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to assist in the early detection of melanoma skin cancer from images. 
Users can upload images or take pictures directly with their devices and receive real-time prediction results. 
The CNN model, trained on a dataset of melanoma and non-melanoma images, achieved X% accuracy in detecting melanoma in test studies. 
However, this application is intended for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment.
